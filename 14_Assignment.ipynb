    "Q.1  What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python.\n",
    "Ans: Multithreading in Python refers to the process of executing multiple threads or tasks simultaneously\n",
    "    within a single program. Each thread runs independently of the others, allowing for more efficient use of \n",
    "    system resources and faster execution of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance of programs that involve I/O operations,\n",
    "    such as web scraping, downloading files, or processing large data sets. By running multiple threads \n",
    "    simultaneously, it is possible to reduce the overall execution time of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, the threading module is used to handle threads. This module provides a simple way to \n",
    "    create and manage threads within a Python program. It includes functions for starting, stopping, \n",
    "    and managing threads, as well as synchronization primitives like locks and semaphores that allow \n",
    "    threads to communicate with each other and coordinate their actions."
